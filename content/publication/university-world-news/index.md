abstract: "The expansion of higher education in the last decades in Brazil has followed a pattern that can also be seen in other countries: diversification and institutional differentiation have profoundly transformed its structure, leading to the adoption of new types of institutions and learning, an improvement in academic standards and wider socio-economic diversity when it comes to students and professors."
